# Description

This module just repackages the [hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter) code into a jar the cqf-ruler can use. None of the code created in this package should be modified. This allows the cqf-ruler to pick up improvements made to the hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter project automatically.
